        PERCEPTION aims to explore different possibilities of on-line image description. To comply with accessibility requirements, alt-text
        is commonly used to help the visually impaired. This standard is predicated on the idea of a neutral observer
        narrating the features of a picture from an objective vantage point.

        This website presents a collection of some of the most bizarre images found on the internet. Instead of using a
        single alt-text interpretation of these oddities, this website allows users to choose from five ‘narrator bots’
        to act as decoders on the images. For example, the Function Bot would only illustrate the utilitarian purpose of
        the picture, while the Feeling Bot would express how it makes it feel. Thus, the user can toggle between
        pragmatic or sentimental depictions.
