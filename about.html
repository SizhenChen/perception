        On this website, there is a collection of the most eccentric images that can be found on-line, images that
        are hard to give “official” descriptions. Therefore, viewers would react distinctly to the same image, and
        that is the purpose. There are already five narrators embedded in the website, five bots of different
        personalities that would describe the images from varied aspects. For example, the function bot would only
        illustrate the functional purpose of the image, and the feeling bot would express how the image makes it
        feel. Apparently, they are the extreme depiction of a pragmatist and a sentimental person. The viewers can
        play with the bots and explore the descriptions they offer to different images, and even input their own
        descriptions. The interesting part of this project is that all the descriptions of the same image can be
        slightly different, because visual and text-based mediums are naturally barriered. Nevertheless, if the
        viewers go through all the descriptions, they can eventually get a full understanding of the image.
